1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples? 
- Any code that affects an outside system.
- local storage, API, websockets, two states to keep in sync

2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples? 
- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data,
  render DOM elements.


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run the effect function? 
- As soon as the components load (first render)
- On every re-render of the components (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when values of the dependencies in the array stay the
  same between renders.


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is? 
- Second parameter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether it should re-run the effect function
